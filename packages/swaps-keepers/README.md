| SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY                   | The private key of the price keeper wallet. This will need to be set in the `FastPriceFeed.sol` contract. This can be checked by calling the `isUpdater` method.                                          |
| VAULT_PRICE_FEED                      | Address for the `VaultPriceFeed.sol` contract                                                                                                                                                             |

| MAX_EXECUTABLE_CHUNK                  | The max amount of orders included in an execution chunk. Since execution is unbounded there were network errors when executing to many orders and receiving too many event logs in return. Defaults to 25 |

| PRICE_KEEPER_FORCE_UDPATE_INTERVAL_MS | If there are no price updates and this interval is reached it will force and update. Defaults to 5 minutes                                                                                                |
| PRICE_KEEPER_INTERVAL_MS              | Interval for the keeper to check if there are any outstanding orders. Defaults to 20 seconds                                                                                                              |

### Watcher Specific Variables.

These variables are specific to the Watcher. If you don't set them, defaults are in place.

```
WATCHER_STALE_THRESHOLD = Time in seconds before the Median price is considered stale in the watcher. Default = 5s
WATCHER_PRICE_DIFF_THRESHOLD = Percent (in 10^18 units) deviation that is acceptable between the median price and keeper price. Default = 5% (0.05Ã—10^18)
```
